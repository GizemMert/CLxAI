Curriculum Scheduler with xAI

This project is developed as part of an advanced machine learning course project. It is based on evaluating explainable AI within curriculum learning strategies, implementing a framework designed to enhance the training process of machine learning models. It involves a series of scheduling methods (from easy to hard examples; applied dropout on images), explainability tools, and different model architectures, different datasets. The repository includes utilities for creating datasets, scheduling training, and evaluating explainability.
